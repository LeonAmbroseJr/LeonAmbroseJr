My name is Leon, I am a student at Oglala Lakota College, located in Rapid City South Dakota! I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Information Technology, I love to keep up with new technology! I am new to ESIIL and Earth data science and look forward to learning code and python. I also have a great passion to de-engineer things to see how they tick. I have a prior degree of an Associates of Applied Science in Automotive Technology.
I play the guitar, I work on my own electronic equipment at home and love to diagnose and troubleshoot. In the near future I plan on building my own guitar effects pedals, I dabble with circuit bread boards to hear what unusual noises electricity and sound waves can produce,  I also own a large collection of guitar effects.I compose digital music as a hobby, I use FL Studio now, but I started off using LMMS (Linux) because of it was a free! and it has taught me a lot about digital workstations. I love all types of music, I love learning by ear for fun. I am a life long student of the Lakota Culture and I am appreciate the opportunity to learn more about Earth Data Science!
