My name is Leon, I am a student at Oglala Lakota College, located in Rapid City South Dakota! I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Information Technology, I love to keep up with new technology! I am new to Earth data science and look forward to learning python. Being a Lakota and how our heritage honors Unci Maka (Mother Earth) I want to help protect her for the future generations in anyway possible. I recognize the importance of keeping our home planet healthy! 
I also have a great passion to de-engineer things to see how they tick. I have a prior degree! an Associates of Applied Science in Automotive Technology.
I play the guitar, bass guitar, I work on my own electronic equipment at home as long as they are repair friendly! I also like to diagnose and troubleshoot. I dabble with electronic circuit bread boards to hear what unusual noises electricity produces into soundwaves in hopes of making my own brand of unique guitar effect pedals, distorions, overdrives, reverbs and modulations, I also own a large collection of guitar effects, my favorite brand is Electro-Harmonix for their distinct sounds. I compose digital music as a hobby, I have been using FL Studio (2025), I started off using LMMS (Linux) because of it was free! and it has taught me a lot about digital workstations and music production. I love all types of music, I love learning songs by ear. I am a committed life long student of life and learning things of interest, writing, mathmatics, science, biology, the world wars, and the Lakota Culture/language and I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about Earth Data Science!
